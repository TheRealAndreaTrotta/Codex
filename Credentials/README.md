# 🎓 Credentials

This section of **Codex** is a structured archive of my **verified learning paths and certifications**.  
It includes courses, hands-on projects, study notes, and final works completed with recognized organizations such as **Harvard University**, **Google**, and **Cisco**.

Each top-level folder maps to an issuer. Inside each issuer, every course has its own subfolder with:

- `/docs` — theory, references, and study notes  
- `/projects` — practice assignments and small builds  
- `/final` — the capstone or major project  
- `/pdf` — official certificates and related files  
- `README.md` — course overview, goals, outcomes, and resources
