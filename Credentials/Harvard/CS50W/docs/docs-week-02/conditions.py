number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

# The code above prompts the user to enter a number and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero
# and prints an appropriate message based on the input.
# Note: There is a typo in the variable name 'numeber' which should be 'number'.
# something simple to demonstrate conditions in Python.
