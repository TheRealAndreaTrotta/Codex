from fun import square
# import fun -> fun.square(i)

for i in range(11):
    print(f"The square of {i} is {square(i)}")

# The code above imports the 'function.py' module which contains the 'square' function.
# It then uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 0 to 10,
# calling the 'square' function for each number and printing the result.
