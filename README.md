# Codex

**Codex** is my personal knowledge compendium — a structured collection of notes, labs, and credentials that reflect my continuous learning in **Computer Science, Web Development, and Cybersecurity**.

It serves as both a study archive and a technical reference: a place where I document what I learn, build, and refine over time through hands-on work, academic study, and professional certifications from institutions such as **Harvard University, Google, and Cisco**.

> **Note on repositories:** flagship projects that I’m most proud of are published as **stand-alone repositories** (with their own READMEs, demos, and issues).  
> **Codex** aggregates everything else to keep my journey organized and searchable — study notes, course/lab work, drafts, roadmaps, and supporting materials.

## Purpose
- Consolidate practical and theoretical knowledge.  
- Track certifications, progress, and skills development.  
- Maintain a transparent record of continuous learning and growth.  

## What lives here
- `/notes` — technical notes and study material.  
- `/labs` — security practice (CTFs, threat models, case studies).  
- `/credentials` — verified certificates and qualifications.  
- `/templates` — reusable docs, checklists, SOPs, and workflows.  
- `/reading` — books, papers, talks with key takeaways.  
- `/roadmap` — goals, OKRs, and learning log.

## What lives elsewhere
- **Flagship projects** — stand-alone repositories with full documentation, tests, and releases.  
  (I’ll link them here under _Portfolio Snapshot_ below.)
